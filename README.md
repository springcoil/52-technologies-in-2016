Slick is a powerful Scala library to work with relational databases.

5. **[Week 5: January 31, 2016](./05-slick)** [Slick: Functional Relational Mapping for Mere Mortals Part 2: Querying Data](./05-slick/README.md). In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform `select` queries with Slick. Slick allows you to work with database tables in the same way as you work with Scala collections. This means that you can use methods like `map`, `filter`, `sort`, etc. to process data in your table.

6. **[Week 6: February 07, 2016](./06-okhttp)** [Building A Lightweight REST API Client with Scala and OkHttp](./06-okhttp/README.md).

CoreOS is an Open source Linux distribution built to run and manage highly scalable and fault tolerant systems.

9. **[Week 9: February 28, 2016](./09-cloudvision)** [Realtime People Counter with Google's Cloud Vision API and RxJava](./09-cloudvision/README.md). Google recently released Cloud Vision API that enables developers to incorporate image recognition in their applications. Image Recognition allow developers to build applications that can understand content of images.  In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a realtime people counter.

10. **[Week 10: March 06, 2016](./10-gatling)** [Gatling: The Ultimate Load Testing Tools for Programmers](./10-gatling/README.md). Gatling is a high performance open source **load testing** tool built on top of Scala, Netty, and Akka. It is a next generation, modern load testing tools very different from existing tools like Apache JMeter. In this tutorial, you will learn how to write load tests using Gatling.

11. **Week 11: March 13, 2016**
  * **[Tweet Deduplication](./11-tweet-deduplication/README.md)**: This week I decided to write a tweet deduplication library. The library will give you a stream of deduplicated tweets.
  * **[TextBlob](./11-textblob/README.md)**. TextBlob is an open source text processing library written in Python. It can be used to perform various natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun-phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, text translation, and many more.

12. **[Week 12: March 20, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/play-the-missing-tutorial)** [Play Framework](https://github.com/shekhargulati/play-the-missing-tutorial).

You can use ArangoDB to model data using combination of document, graph, and key value data modeling styles.

14. **[Week 14: April 03, 2016](./14-kafka)** [Apache Kafka](./14-kafka/README.md). I have not yet written this article.

15. **[Week 15: April 10, 2016](./15-huginn)** [Airline Bot Platform with Huginn](./15-huginn/README.md). This week I decided to build a bot platform using **Huginn** that can perform a lot of tasks for which we normally use mobile apps. Our goal was to show them that they should think beyond mobile apps and look into the world of bots as bots can be less intrusive, more secure, and does not require installation. Apps are dead, long live bots.
